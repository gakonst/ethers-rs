#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg))]
//! Type-safe abstractions for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts
//!
//! Interacting with a smart contract requires broadcasting carefully crafted
//! [transactions](ethers_core::types::TransactionRequest) where the `data` field contains
//! the [function's
//! selector](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/72363/what-is-a-function-selector)
//! along with the arguments of the called function. This module provides the
//! [`Contract`] and [`ContractFactory`] abstractions so that you do not have to worry about that.
//! It also provides typesafe bindings via the [`abigen`] macro and the [`Abigen` builder].
//!
//! [`ContractFactory`]: crate::ContractFactory
//! [`Contract`]: crate::Contract
//! [`abigen`]: ./macro.abigen.html
//! [`Abigen` builder]: crate::Abigen
