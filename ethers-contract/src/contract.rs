/// A Contract is an abstraction of an executable program on the Ethereum Blockchain.
/// It has code (called byte code) as well as allocated long-term memory
/// (called storage). Every deployed Contract has an address, which is used to connect
/// to it so that it may be sent messages to call its methods.
///
/// A Contract can emit Events, which can be efficiently observed by applications
/// to be notified when a contract has performed specific operation.
///
/// There are two types of methods that can be called on a Contract:
///
/// 1. A Constant method may not add, remove or change any data in the storage,
/// nor log any events, and may only call Constant methods on other contracts.
/// These methods are free (no Ether is required) to call. The result from them
/// may also be returned to the caller. Constant methods are marked as `pure` and
/// `view` in Solidity.
///
/// 2. A Non-Constant method requires a fee (in Ether) to be paid, but may perform
/// any state-changing operation desired, log events, send ether and call Non-Constant
/// methods on other Contracts. These methods cannot return their result to the caller.
/// These methods must be triggered by a transaction, sent by an Externally Owned Account
/// (EOA) either directly or indirectly (i.e. called from another contract), and are
/// required to be mined before the effects are present. Therefore, the duration
/// required for these operations can vary widely, and depend on the transaction
/// gas price, network congestion and miner priority heuristics.
///
/// The Contract API provides simple way to connect to a Contract and call its methods,
/// as functions on a Rust struct, handling all the binary protocol conversion,
/// internal name mangling and topic construction. This allows a Contract object
/// to be used like any standard Rust struct, without having to worry about the
/// low-level details of the Ethereum Virtual Machine or Blockchain.
///
/// The Contract definition (called an Application Binary Interface, or ABI) must
/// be provided to instantiate a contract and the available methods and events will
/// be made available to call by providing their name as a `str` via the [`method`]
/// and [`event`] methods. If non-existing names are given, the function/event call
/// will fail.
///
/// Alternatively, you can _and should_ use the [`abigen`] macro, or the [`Abigen` builder]
/// to generate type-safe bindings to your contracts.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Assuming we already have our contract deployed at `address`, we'll proceed to
/// interact with its methods and retrieve raw logs it has emitted.

/// # Usage Note
///
/// `ContractInternal` accepts any client that implements `B: Borrow<M>` where
/// `M :Middleware`. Previous `Contract` versions used only arcs, and relied
/// heavily on [`Arc`]. Due to constraints on the [`FunctionCall`] type,
/// calling contracts requires a `B: Borrow<M> + Clone`. This is fine for most
/// middlware. However, when `B` is an owned middleware that is not Clone, we
/// cannot issue contract calls. Some notable exceptions:
///
/// - `NonceManagerMiddleware`
/// - `SignerMiddleware` (when using a non-Clone Signer)
///
/// When using non-Clone middlewares, instead of instantiating a contract that
/// OWNS the middlware, pass the contract a REFERENCE to the middleware. This
/// will fix the trait bounds issue (as `&M` is always `Clone`).
///
/// We expect to fix this fully in a future version
