**Complete Ethereum and Celo wallet implementation and utilities in Rust**

![Github Actions](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## Documentation

Extensive documentation and examples are available [here](https://docs.rs/ethers).

Alternatively, you may clone the repository and run `cd ethers/ && cargo doc --open`

## Add ethers-rs to your repository

```toml
[dependencies]

ethers = { git = "https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs" }
```

</details>

## Running the tests

Tests require the following installed:
1. [`solc`](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html)
2. [`ganache-cli`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli#installation)

In addition, it is recommended that you set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable 
for [the abigen via Etherscan](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/ethers/tests/major_contracts.rs) tests. 
You can get one [here](https://etherscan.io/apis).

### Celo Support

[Celo](http://celo.org/) support is turned on via the feature-flag `celo`:

```toml
[dependencies]

ethers = { git = "https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs", features = ["celo"] }
```

Celo's transactions differ from Ethereum transactions by including 3 new fields:
- `fee_currency`: The currency fees are paid in (None for CELO, otherwise it's an Address)
- `gateway_fee_recipient`: The address of the fee recipient (None for no gateway fee paid)
- `gateway_fee`: Gateway fee amount (None for no gateway fee paid)

The feature flag enables these additional fields in the transaction request builders and
in the transactions which are fetched over JSON-RPC.

## Related Projects

This library would not have been possibly without the great work done in:
- [`ethers.js`](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)
- [`rust-web3`](https://github.com/tomusdrw/rust-web3/)
- [`ethcontract-rs`](https://github.com/gnosis/ethcontract-rs/)
- [`guac_rs`](https://github.com/althea-net/guac_rs/tree/master/web3/src/jsonrpc)

A lot of the code was inspired and adapted from them, to a unified and opinionated interface,
built with async/await and std futures from the ground up.
